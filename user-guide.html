        The <strong>Monthly Attendance Punch Tracker</strong> helps you record daily punch-in
        and punch-out times for <em>Teaching</em> and <em>Non-Teaching</em> employees. It automatically
        evaluates each entry against the applicable attendance rules and marks the record as
        <strong>Compliant</strong> or <strong>Non-Compliant</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>All data is stored locally in your browser — nothing is sent to a server.</p>
